/** @brief A LCH color.
 *
 * Storage of floating point LCH values with <tt>double</tt> precision.
 *
 * The data is not default-initializad; it is undefined when the object
 * is created.
 *
 * Example:
 * @snippet test/testlchdouble.cpp Use LchDouble
 *
 * More details about the valid range: @ref lchrange
 *
 * This class intentionally does not provide the operators <em>equal
 * to</em> (<tt>operator==</tt>) and <em>not equal to</em>
 * (<tt>operator!=</tt>). As LCH colors are polar coordinates,
 * there are various valid representations of the same angle.
 * And h is even meaningless when C is zero; on the other hand,
 * there might nevertheless be an interest in preserving h. And
 * invalid values with L=200 or L=300: Should they be equal because
 * both are invalid? Or are they different? The anser to all
 * these questions depends on your use case. To avoid confusion,
 * no coparision operators are provided by this class. See also
 * @ref hasSameCoordinates.
 *
 * This type is declared as type to Qt’s type system via
 * <tt>Q_DECLARE_METATYPE</tt>. Depending on your use case (for
 * example if you want to use it reliably in Qt’s signals
 * and slots), you might consider calling <tt>qRegisterMetaType()</tt> for
 * this type, once you have a QApplication object.
 *
 * This data type can be passed to QDebug thanks to
 * @ref operator<<(QDebug dbg, const PerceptualColor::LchDouble &value)
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @todo Would it make sense to normalize the hue (1° instead
 * of 361°, and only non-negatif radials) and/or to bound the
 * @ref l component to the range <tt>[0, 100]</tt> and/or
 * to bound the radial to the range <tt>[0, 255]</tt> or
 * <tt>[0, @ref LchValues::humanMaximumChroma]</tt>? */
